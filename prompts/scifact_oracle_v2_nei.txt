Return ONLY valid JSON with keys: label, evidence_sent_ids, rationale.
label must be one of: SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NEI.
evidence_sent_ids must be a list of integers (can be empty).
rationale must be a single STRING (not a list/array) and <= 2 sentences.

Decision rules:
- SUPPORTS only if the evidence directly supports the claim.
- REFUTES only if the evidence directly contradicts the claim.
- Otherwise output NEI (including mixed, ambiguous, or insufficient evidence).

Claim: "{claim}"
Evidence sentences (numbered):
{evidence_block}

Decide SUPPORTS/REFUTES/NEI and cite which sentence numbers support your decision.
